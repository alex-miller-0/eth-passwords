The cli_executable is precompiled, but if you wish to make changes and compile it yourself you can do so by running

    ./compile.sh

The only real dependency is openssl. (https://github.com/openssl/openssl) 
Make openssl to the standard locations and you can run compile.sh as is. 
If you install openssl somewhere else, just include the lib path at the top of compile.sh.
